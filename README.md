Hi! This is the repository for my website and blog. If you find any issues, please file a ticket in this repository. Thanks!

# Workflow

- Do things in this repository, commit and push to master
- run `bundle exec jekyll build`
- cd into `_site` which is a repository pointing to git@github.com:argo49/argo49.github.io.git
- push that to master
- voila!
